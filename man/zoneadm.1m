.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBzoneadm\fR utility is used to administer system zones. A zone is an
application container that is maintained by the operating system runtime.
.SH SECURITY
.LP
Once a process has been placed in a zone other than zone \fB0\fR, the process
or any of its children cannot change zones.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-R\fR \fIroot\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Specify an alternate root (boot environment). This option can only be used in
conjunction with the "\fBlist\fR" and "\fBmark\fR" subcommands.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-u\fR \fIuuid-match\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Unique identifier for a zone, as assigned by \fBlibuuid\fR(3LIB). If this
option is present and the argument is a non-empty string, then the zone
matching the \fBUUID\fR is selected instead of the one named by the \fB-z\fR
option, if such a zone is present.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-z\fR \fIzonename\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
String identifier for a zone.
.RE

.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.LP
Subcommands which can result in destructive actions or loss of work have a
\fB-F\fR flag to force the action. If input is from a terminal device, the user
is prompted if such a command is given without the \fB-F\fR flag; otherwise, if
such a command is given without the \fB-F\fR flag, the action is disallowed,
with a diagnostic message written to standard error. If a zone installation or
uninstallation is interrupted, the zone is left in the incomplete state. Use
uninstall to reset such a zone back to the configured state.
.sp
.LP
The following subcommands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBattach\fR [\fB-F\fR] [\fB-n\fR \fIpath\fR] [\fIbrand-specific
options\fR]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fBattach\fR subcommand takes a zone that has been detached from one system
and attaches the zone onto a new system. Therefore, it is advised (though not
required) that the \fBdetach\fR subcommand should be run before the "attach"
takes place. Once you have the new zone in the configured state, use the
\fBattach\fR subcommand to set up the zone root instead of installing the zone
as a new zone.
.sp
The \fB-F\fR option can be used to force the zone into the "installed" state
with no validation. This option should be used with care since it can leave the
zone in an unsupportable state if it was moved from a source system to a target
system that is unable to properly host the zone. The \fB-n\fR option can be
used to run the \fBattach\fR subcommand, without executing the command. It uses
the output of the "\fBdetach\fR \fB-n\fR" subcommand as input and is useful to
identify any conflicting issues, such as the network device being incompatible,
and can also determine whether the host is capable of supporting the zone. The
path can be "\fB-\fR", to read the input from standard input.
.sp
The zone's brand may include additional options that govern how the zone will
be attached. See \fBbrands\fR(5) for specific brand information.
.sp
The zone being attached must first be configured using the \fBzonecfg\fR (see
\fBzonecfg\fR(1M)) command. This does not apply when running "\fBattach\fR
\fB-n\fR".
.sp
Use the following command to attach a zone:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# \fBzoneadm -z my-zone attach\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBboot\fR [\fB--\fR \fIboot_options\fR]\fR

The following \fIboot_options\fR are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-i\fR \fIaltinit\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Select an alternative executable to be the primordial Process. \fIaltinit\fR is
a valid path to an executable. The default primordial process is
\fBinit\fR(1M).
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-m\fR \fIsmf_options\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
The \fIsmf_options\fR include two categories of options to control booting
behavior of the service management facility: recovery options and messages
options.
.sp
Message options determine the type and amount of messages that \fBsmf\fR(5)
displays during boot. Service options determine the services which are used to
boot the system. See \fBkernel\fR(1M) for a listing of the \fB-m\fR suboptions.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB-s\fR\fR

.sp .6

Boots only to milestone \fBsvc:/milestone/single-user:default\fR. This
milestone is equivalent to init level \fBs\fR. See \fBsvc.startd\fR(1M) and
\fBinit\fR(1M).

alternative way to install the zone.
.sp

Specify the name of a \fBZFS\fR snapshot to use as the source of the clone. The
\fIsnapshot\fR must be a \fIsnapshot\fR of the source zone taken from a
previous "\fBzoneadm\fR clone" installation.
.RE

The source zone must be halted before this subcommand can be used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBdetach\fR [\fB-n\fR]\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Detach the specified zone. Detaching a zone is the first step in moving a zone
from one system to another. The full procedure to migrate a zone is that the
zone is detached, the \fIzonepath\fR directory is moved to the new host, and
then the zone is attached on the new host. Once the zone is detached, it is
left in the configured state. If you try to install or clone to a configured
zone that has been detached, you will receive an error message and the
\fBinstall\fR or \fBclone\fR subcommand will not be allowed to proceed. The
\fB-n\fR option can be used to run the \fBdetach\fR subcommand, without
executing the command. This generates the information needed for running the
"\fBattach\fR \fB-n\fR" subcommand, which is useful to identify any conflicting
issues, such as the network device being incompatible or if the host is capable
of supporting the zone. The information is sent to standard output and can be
saved to a file or piped to the "\fBattach\fR \fB-n\fR" subcommand.
.sp
Use the following command to detach a zone:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# zoneadm -z my-zone detach
.fi
.in -2
.sp

The source zone must be halted before this subcommand can be used.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fBhalt\fR\fR

.sp
By default, all running zones are listed. If you use this subcommand with the
\fBzoneadm\fR \fB-z\fR \fIzonename\fR option, it lists only the specified zone,
regardless of its state. In this case, the \fB-i\fR and \fB-c\fR options are
disallowed.
.sp
If neither the \fB-i\fR or \fB-c\fR options are given, all running zones are
listed.
.sp
The following \fIlist_options\fR are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Display all configured zones. This option overides the \fB-i\fR option.

Request machine parsable output. The output format is a list of lines, one per

.sp
.in +2

zoneid:zonename:state:zonepath:uuid:brand:ip-type
.fi
.in -2
.sp

If the \fBzonepath\fR contains embedded colons, they can be escaped by a
backslash ("\:"), which is parsable by using the shell \fBread\fR(1) function
with the environmental variable \fBIFS\fR. The \fIuuid\fR value is assigned by
\fBlibuuid\fR(3LIB) when the zone is installed, and is useful for identifying
the same zone when present (or renamed) on alternate boot environments. Any
software that parses the output of the "\fBzoneadm list -p\fR" command must be
able to handle any fields that may be added in the future.
.sp
The \fB-v\fR and \fB-p\fR options are mutually exclusive. If neither \fB-v\fR

.LP
The act of installing a new non-global zone is a fresh installation of the
Solaris operating system. A new installation of Solaris must not require
interaction with the user (that is, it must be "hands off"). Because of this,
packages installed in the global zone and all non-global zones cannot contain
request scripts (see \fBpkgask\fR(1M)). If a package did have a request script,
then the creation of a non-global zone could not be done without user
intervention. Any package that contains a request script is added to the global
zone only. See \fBpkgadd\fR(1M).
